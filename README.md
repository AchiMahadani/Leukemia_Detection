Leukemia Detection using Deep Learning and Vision Transformer (ViT)
This project focuses on detecting leukemia from blood smear images using advanced deep learning techniques. Early diagnosis of leukemia is critical for effective treatment, and this project aims to automate the detection process using a Vision Transformer (ViT) model.

Project Overview
Leukemia is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow, and detecting it early through medical imaging can improve treatment outcomes. This project employs the Vision Transformer (ViT) model, which has proven to be highly effective in image classification tasks. ViT treats images as sequences of patches, leveraging the transformer architecture to learn meaningful patterns from the input data.

Key Features:
Vision Transformer Model: The ViT model splits each image into patches and uses a transformer encoder to classify the presence of leukemia.
Data Augmentation: To improve the generalization of the model, various data augmentation techniques are applied to the input images.
Transfer Learning: The model is fine-tuned using pre-trained weights to enhance its performance on the leukemia dataset.
Performance Metrics: The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC to ensure reliable performance.
Model Details
The Vision Transformer (ViT) model is utilized in this project to classify blood smear images into two categories: Leukemia and Non-Leukemia. The images are resized and normalized before being split into smaller patches, which are then processed through the transformer encoder layers. The final classification layer determines the presence or absence of leukemia in the images.

Dataset
The dataset consists of blood smear images that have been labeled to indicate the presence of leukemia. Data preprocessing includes resizing the images to 224x224 pixels and applying augmentations like random flips and rotations to increase the robustness of the model.

Classes: Leukemia, Non-Leukemia
Preprocessing: Resizing, normalization, and augmentation
Results
After training and evaluating the model, the following performance metrics were achieved:

Accuracy: X%
Precision: X%
Recall: X%
F1-Score: X%
AUC: X%
Visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves can be used to further analyze the model's performance.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of Vision Transformers for detecting leukemia from blood smear images. By automating the diagnostic process, this model can assist medical professionals in making faster and more accurate decisions.
